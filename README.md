In high-risk environments like military operations, mines, and disaster zones, real-time monitoring of personnel is crucial for timely intervention. We propose a Soldier Position Tracking and Health Monitoring System that tracks vital health parameters—heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, motion, and UV exposure—along with GPS location. A wearable module transmits data via low-power LoRa to a base station, which can alert emergency contacts through Twilio. An SOS button allows manual alerts in critical situations. This system improves situational awareness and response times, enhancing safety in life-threatening scenarios.
